## What is LatterFix?

**LatterFix** (TaskManager Pro) is a decentralized platform designed to redefine how organizations and independent builders collaborate. By replacing trust-based arrangements with automated, secure, and verifiable smart contract workflows, LatterFix ensures that contributors get paid for their verified contributions while creators get the quality deliverables they expect.

### Core Pillars:
1. **Decentralized Escrows & Milestones**: Funds are locked in a secure smart contract when tasks are created. Payments can be released incrementally through predefined milestones or fully upon total task verification.
2. **On-Chain Reputation System**: Every contributor has a dynamically adjusted reputation score. Reputation grows with successful task completions and milestone approvals, and drops with cancellations or lost disputes.
3. **Decentralized Governance**: Platform parameters and configurations are governed by the community. Proposal weight is tied directly to users' on-chain reputation scores, encouraging positive participation.
4. **Built-in Dispute Resolution**: If disputes arise during the delivery cycle, platform administrators or delegated moderators can mediate and split the escrowed funds fairly based on the evidence provided.

## Overview

This repository contains the Soroban smart contract powering the LatterFix TaskManager Pro platform. The contract implements a complete decentralized escrow workflow — locking task rewards on-chain, routing platform fees, milestone-based payments, dispute resolution, governance, and a comprehensive reputation system.

## Data Structures

---

## Development

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Add WebAssembly target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Install Stellar CLI
cargo install --locked stellar-cli
```

### Run Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Build WASM Binary

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

### Build Optimized WASM

```bash
stellar contract build
```

### Deploy to Testnet

```bash
# Configure testnet
stellar network add testnet \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443 \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"

# Deploy
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/task_manager_pro.wasm \
  --network testnet \
  --source <your-account>
```

### Running the TTL Monitoring Bot

The repository includes an automated background bot (`tooling/ttl_bot.py`) to track contract storage TTL and send bump transactions before expiration.

**1. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install stellar-sdk>=9.0.0 requests
```

**2. Run the Bot**
```bash
python3 tooling/ttl_bot.py \
  --secret-key "<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>" \
  --contract-ids "<CONTRACT_ID_1>,<CONTRACT_ID_2>" \
  --interval 3600
```

**Bot Options:**
- `--dry-run`: Run without actually sending transactions.
- `--threshold`: TTL threshold in ledgers to trigger renewal (default: `10000`).
- `--extend-to`: Number of ledgers to extend the TTL to (default: `50000`).
- `--min-balance`: Minimum XLM balance for the bot wallet before alerting (default: `10.0`).
- `--interval`: Run continuously every N seconds (default: `0`, which means run once and exit).

## Security Considerations

1. **Re-entrancy**: All state changes happen before external calls
2. **Access Control**: Admin-only functions are protected by `require_auth`
3. **Overflow Protection**: All arithmetic uses checked operations
4. **Pause Mechanism**: Emergency stop capability for critical vulnerabilities
5. **Fee Limits**: Platform fee capped at 10% (1000 basis points)

---

## Gas Optimization

- Storage keys use minimal byte representation
- TTL management prevents storage churn
- Instance storage for frequently accessed data
- Persistent storage for user profiles and historical data
